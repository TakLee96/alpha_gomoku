Thoughts
========

1. Implement MCTS with Dagger Agent and see if it is good
1. Implement Policy Gradient
1. Train same network on Existing dataset and compete with Dagger Agent

Questions
=========

1. Is the CNN confused? Do we really need two networks?
1. Purely Supervised, Purely DAgger or Combined, which one is better?
